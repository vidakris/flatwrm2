# FLATW'RM2 - coming soon!

FLATW'RM2 is a deep learning code that was developed to detect flares in light curves obtained by space observatories (like Kepler or TESS). 

The code was developed using the Keras API \footnote{\url{keras.io}}: a deep learning API built on Tensorflow.

The source code, weight files and additional utilities will be available upon the acceptance of the paper.
